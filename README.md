# PREDICTING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF VIETNAMESE ENTERPRISES USING MARGIN LENDING CATEGORIZATION

This study uses Machine Learning models to predict and evaluate profits and also identify 
factors that influence organizational profitability. The research was based on actual data 
from the financial statements of 512 companies listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange 
from 2010 to 2020. Recognizing the limits of past studies' techniques, the team proposes to 
perform profit forecasting research using two ways: by year and by industry, which yields 
two important results. First, the model's profit or loss performance is fairly strong, 
particularly for the 2012 and 2020 models, as well as the healthcare model. Second, in the 
data fields, ROA, Net profit margin, ROE, and DSO are qualities that have a significant 
impact on profit forecasting. Furthermore, unlike the model decomposed by industry, the 
model decomposed by years does not account for the effect of macro variables.
